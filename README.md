# The Arctic sea ice cover of 2016: A year of record low highs and higher than expected lows
**Alek Petty**

*Python scripts used to produce the Arctic sea ice concentration budgets and monthly extent/area records. Results from this analysis were recently accepted for publication in The Cryosphere.*

### Scripts

Individual descriptions should be included at the top of each script. 

Python 2.7 was used for all processing. I have not tested these scripts in Python 3.

I use Conda to intall/manage the various Python packages. Check out the file 'packages.txt' for a list of the Python package versions I used to run these Scripts. I should probably do this in a conda environment and output that information at some point.

Information about installing Conda/Python, and a brief introduction to using Python can be found on my NASA Cryospheric Sciences meetup repo: https://github.com/akpetty/cryoscripts.

### Data

The gridded forecast datasets were generated from the following, publically available datasets:

Sea ice concentration data (NASA Team, final): http://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0051    
Sea ice concentration data (NASA Team, near real-time): https://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0081   


I need to add the KIMURA drifts (maybe the gridded data).

Contact me if you any any questions (alek.a.petty@nasa.gov)!
